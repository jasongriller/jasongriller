  Multi-TC Aware Modal — The editor now groups test cases by their parent TC (TC01, TC02, etc.) with collapsible black header bars, per-TC step numbering, and per-TC editing (add/remove/edit steps). Before, it was a   flat list of steps with no grouping.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4 Export Formats:                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  - Basic CSV — Simple Step | Action | Expected Result table, grouped by TC name
  - Provar Manager — Two-sheet format (TestCases + TestSteps) for Provar import
  - Provar Data-Driven — Includes fieldName, fieldValue, questionId columns for parameterized test automation
  - ADO Test Case — Azure DevOps-compatible format with validation types and error fields

  -  Quality Self-Check — Prompt includes a built-in quality gate so the LLM validates its own output before returning, reducing generic/low-quality results
