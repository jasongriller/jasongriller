We fixed the AI assistant so that when someone asks it to break down a feature, it actually asks useful questions about how to split the work up instead of asking generic questions about Salesforce fields and data models.
                                                                                                                                                                             
Before, it was basically following a generic checklist. Now it focuses on what matters — what are the pieces, what order do they go in, and what already exists. 

Before it was cycling through this:  

1. Purpose                                                                                                                                                                  
2. Location in Salesforce
3. User Roles                                                                                                                                                              
4. Data Model   
5. Workflow
6. Business Rules
7. UI Components
